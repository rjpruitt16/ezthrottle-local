# API reference

## Submit a job

```bash
POST /jobs
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "user_id": "user_123",
  "idempotent_key": "order-456-attempt-1",
  "url": "https://api.yourservice.com/process",
  "method": "POST",
  "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer sk-..." },
  "body": "{\"input\": \"data\"}",
  "webhook_url": "https://yourapp.com/webhooks/results"
}
```

**Response headers your API can return to control pacing:**

| Header | Effect |
|---|---|
| `X-EZTHROTTLE-RPS: 10` | Raise or lower requests per second |
| `X-EZTHROTTLE-MAX-CONCURRENT: 5` | Change max in-flight requests |
| `X-EZTHROTTLE-ACCOUNT-QUEUE: enabled` | Switch to per-tenant queue isolation |

## POST /proxy

Edge-gateway mode — see [Use cases](README.md#use-cases) for the deployment shape this is for. Same request body as `POST /jobs`, same idempotency/admission rules, but tries the upstream directly and synchronously first:

- **Succeeds directly** (2xx, no overload signal): the real upstream's status, headers, and body are relayed back verbatim, on this same connection. The queue is never touched.
- **Fails or the upstream signals overload** (timeout, 5xx, `429`, or an ORCA fallback threshold): falls back to the exact same durable-queue-and-delivery path `POST /jobs` uses — the connection seamlessly becomes the same SSE stream `GET /jobs/:id/stream` provides, rather than requiring a second call. The very first event on that stream is `event: proxy_fallback`, `data: {"job_id", "reason", "upstream_status"}` (status omitted when no real response was received — a skipped attempt or a timeout) — so a client with no server of its own to explain this any other way (a browser, an agent) sees explicitly why it's in the queue before the normal `queued`/`dispatching`/terminal sequence starts. `reason` is one of `upstream_overloaded`, `upstream_unreachable`, `domain_degraded` (breaker open or this domain's queue already has backlog), or `pool_routed`.

A domain that trips an overload signal has its direct attempts skipped entirely — anchored to the upstream's own `Retry-After` header when it sends one (× a configurable safety multiplier, default 3) as the minimum cooldown, but direct attempts stay skipped for as long as the domain's queue actually has real backlog, even past that cooldown — a fixed timer alone doesn't know whether the traffic it caused has finished draining. Once both the cooldown has elapsed *and* the queue is genuinely empty, the next request is itself a real probe against the live upstream.

The upstream can also proactively request this itself, on an otherwise-healthy response: `X-Aqueduct-Queue-Active: true` (or the product alias `X-EZTHROTTLE-QUEUE-ACTIVE`) trips the same breaker for future requests to that domain — without discarding the response that already came back. Useful for "I'm nearing capacity, stop firing directly at me" ahead of an actual `429`/`5xx`.

Pool-routed jobs (`pool_id` instead of `url`) always fall straight to queue+stream — there's no single canonical upstream to try directly.

```bash
POST /proxy
Content-Type: application/json

{ ... same shape as POST /jobs ... }
```

## Stream job events (SSE)

```bash
GET /jobs/:id/stream
```

Opens a server-sent event stream. Events: `queued`, `position`, `dispatching`, `completed`, `failed`. Keepalive pings sent every 30 seconds. If you disconnect before completion, the result is delivered to your `webhook_url`.

## Check job status

```bash
GET /jobs/:id
```

## Health check

```bash
GET /health
```
